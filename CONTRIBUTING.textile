h1. Contributing

Please take a quick look at this document before to make contribution process easier for all parties involved.

h2. License

"MIT":https://raw.github.com/textile/php-textile/blob/master/LICENSE. By contributing code, you agree to license your additions under the MIT license.

h2. Versioning

"Semantic Versioning":http://semver.org/.

h2. Opening an issue

When opening an issue:

* State where the issue occurs. Whether on the "production website":http://forum.textpattern.com/ or against the current codebase and in which branch.
* If the issue occurs on the production website, if possible please try to reproduce it against the current codebase by setting up a local copy of the site. If you are unable to do so, you can still open up an issue, but please make it clear that you've ran into it on just the current live version.

h2. Configure git

For convenience your committer, git user, should be linked to your GitHub account:

bc. $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email john.doe@example.com

Make sure to use an email address that is linked to your GitHub account. It can be a throwaway address or you can use GitHub's email protection features. We don't want your emails, but this is to make sure we know who did what. All commits nicely link to their author, instead of them coming from foobar@invalid.tld.

h2. Testing

JavaScript tests are run using Grunt:

bc. $ grunt test
