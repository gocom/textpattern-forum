h2. Setup

h3. Installing required tools

The project uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ to run tasks and "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ for CSS pre-processing. This creates few dependencies in addition to your normal PHP required by Textpattern. First make sure you have base dependencies installed: "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/, "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/, "Bundler":http://bundler.io/, "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ and "Bower":http://bower.io/. You can install Node, Ruby and "Composer":http://getcomposer.org/ using their installers, Bunder with gem and the rest with npm:

bc. $ gem install bundler
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install -g bower

Consult the tools' documentation for more instructions. Outside from these, the project will also require the normal git, Apache, MySQL and PHP. All requirements must be added to your path variable.

h3. Setting up Apache virtual host

The @public/@ directory is intended to be set as the server's document root. You can do this by adding a new virtual host to your httpd.conf. Along the lines of:

bc. <VirtualHost *:80>
    VirtualHost "/absolute/path/to/textpattern-forum/public"
    ServerName forum.textpattern.test
</VirtualHost>

On a local development server, after this you can use your hosts file to point the development domain to correct location (e.g. back to home), run a local DNS server that resolves .test TLDs, or use a "xip.io":http://xip.io/ domain.

h3. Installing dependencies

After you have the base dependencies taken care of, you can install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the project's directory, and run the dependency managers:

bc. $ cd textpattern-forum
$ npm install
$ bundle install
$ bower install
$ composer install

*npm* installs Node modules for Grunt, *bundle* takes care of Ruby gems, *bower* manages client-side scripts and *composer* installs PHP libraries.

h3. Installing FluxBB

Once you have Grunt installed, installing and updating FluxBB is easy. To setup or update FluxBB run:

bc. $ grunt setup

This will download the correct release version FluxBB, patch it with mods and place it in the @public/@ directory. Complete FluxBB's installation by following the normal "Installation steps":http://fluxbb.org/docs/v1.5/installing, and use "this as your config.php template":https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern-forum/blob/master/src/setup/config.dist.php.

After you have finished installing, run the postsetup task to remove extra trash left by the setup:

bc. $ grunt postsetup

h3. Updating and patching FluxBB

Periodically we update the "patch files":https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern-forum/tree/master/src/setup/patches that ship with the repository. To re-patch and update your FluxBB installation, run the setup task again:

bc. $ grunt setup

If FluxBB installation version has changed, access your forums and follow the updating steps.

h2. Building

This repository hosts sources and needs to be built before it can be used. After you have installed all dependencies, you will be able to run tasks using Grunt, including building:

bc. $ grunt [task]

Where the @[task]@ is either @test@, @build@, @setup@ or @watch@. Watch will launch a task that watches for file changes. The project is automatically built if a source file is modified. The build task builds the project.
